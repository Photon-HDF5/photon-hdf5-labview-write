The VI takes a Metadata cluster as input argument. Note that measurement types other than \"smFRET\" will require additional parameters and a modified Write Temp YAML File.vi code. Modifications should be easy based on this example and referring to the photon-HDF5 documentation.\r\n\r\n![Write Temp Data HDF5 File.png](Figures/Write Temp Data HDF5 File.png?raw=true \"Write Temp Data HDF5 File.vi\")\r\n\r\n<b>Write Temp Data HDF5 File.vi</b> (shown above) is a VI that writes the measurement's data in a temporary HDF5 file used by <b>phforge Script.vi</b>. The VI takes two arrays (Photon Detector IDs and Photon Time Stamps) as input arguments. This VI requires that the HDF5 library and h5labview wrapper be installed.\r\n\r\n![phforge Script.png](Figures/phforge Script.png?raw=true \"phforge Script.vi\")\r\n\r\n<b>phforge Script.vi</b> (shown above) takes the two files generated by the above VIs as input arguments, and requires an additional file path to save the final Photon-HDF5 file.\r\nWarning: if the destination file path is already used by another file, this file will be overwritten!\r\n\r\nphforge Script returns the following parameters:\r\n- Error out: standard LabVIEW error structure\r\n- Standard Output: message returned by phforge\r\n- Standard Error: error message returned by phforge\r\n- Return Code: 0 if no error, 1 if an error occurred during the execution of phforge.\r\n\r\n![Write Simple smFRET Photon-HDF5 File.png](Figures/Write Simple smFRET Photon-HDF5 File.png?raw=true \"Write Simple smFRET Photon-HDF5 File.vi\")\r\n\r\n<b>Write Simple smFRET Photon-HDF5 File.vi</b> (shown above) puts things together and takes 4 input arguments (Metadata cluster, Photon Detector IDs and Photon Time Stamps arrays and Destination File Path).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
