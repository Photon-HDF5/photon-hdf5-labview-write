# photon-hdf5-labview-write
Example of how to write the files needed to use phforge, and how to call phforge in LabVIEW

This repository contains 4 LabVIEW 2010 VIs:
- phforge Script.vi
- Write Temp YAML File.vi
- Write Temp Data HDF5 File.vi
- Boolean to String.vi

The two "Write" VIs need to be executed before running phforge Script.vi, as the files they generate need to be passed as arguments of the Script.

Write Temp YAML File.vi is a simple example showing how to write the information needed to describe a single-laser, two detectors smFRET experiment. Boolean to String.vi is a utility used by this VI.

Write Temp Data HDF5 File.vi is a simple example showing how to write the measurement's data in a temporary HDF5 file used by the phforge Script.vi. This VI requires that the HDF5 library and h5labview wrapper be installed.

phforge Script.vi takes the two files generated by the above VIs as argument, and requires an additional file path to save the final Photon-HDF5 file. Warning: if the path is already used by another file, this file will be overwritten!

phforge Script returns the following parameters:
- Error out: standard LabVIEW error structure
- Standard Output: message returned by phforge
- Standard Error: error message returned by phforge
- Return Code: 0 if no error, 1 if an error occurred during the execution of phforge.
